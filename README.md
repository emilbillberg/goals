# GOALS - 2017

## July

- [x] **Create a repository called Goals**

  Yay! You are reading it!

- [x] **Establish goals for July**

  Success! Eight goals were established for July.

- [x] **Complete six sessions in [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)**

  Awesome! I completed the first six sessions! So far it has been a great introduction and I will keep a similar goal next month.

- [x] **Find a course in [MongoDB University]( https://university.mongodb.com/) I would like to take**

  Boom! Found a course and signed up for a course! I signed up for the three week course [M001: MongoDB Basics](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M001/about).

- [x] **Add six rules to my personal [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/emilbillberg/javascript-style-guide)**

  Fantastic! Added eight rules to my style guide. I added some rules to Object, Arrays, & Strings. Many more rules needs to be added. The style guide is heavily inspired by [Airbnb's styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/README.md)

- [ ] **Write a Medium article about a topic inspired from [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)**

  Nope! I never found a good topic or motivation to do it this month. Maybe I will keep this goal for another month...

- [x] **Find an Open Source project I could see myself contribute to**

  Good! I have looked at two Open Source projects I am considering: [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs) or [Polymer](https://github.com/Polymer).

- [ ] **Make a pull request to the [issue](https://github.com/WICG/focus-ring/issues/28) I opened in [focus-ring](https://github.com/WICG/focus-ring)**

  Nope! I did an attempt at fixing this issue. Although, it would require many changes to the code that is already implemented. I might have to look at a better solution that require a smaller impact on the current project.
